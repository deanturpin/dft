Looking at the largest peaks starting on the left: I'd say it's just shy of
concert pitch E, with two E octaves and a B 5th. There's also a smidgen of high
G. Energy also extends into the higher frequencies. A sparkler?

Peaks at: 81, 162, 243, 324 Hz.

A strong fundamental at 81 Hz, just flat of E2.
Textbook first harmonic (octave) followed by a near perfect 5th (B3) and a
strong second octave. High frequency sparkle extends out as far as 1940 Hz.
