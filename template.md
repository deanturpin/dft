A discrete Fourier transform implementation using no third-party libraries.
Initially written to study the spectral response of my digeridoo. See
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform) for the
algorithm. For each sample two plots are rendered: all Fourier bins and a second
zoomed into the first section. See the [pitch table](pitch.md) for concert pitch
frequencies.
